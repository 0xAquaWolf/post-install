# Post Install script for Fedora 38 Linux

The main purpose of this install script is to quickly bootstrap and setup a Fedora instance locally or in the cloud with all of my favorite tools and config

### How to run the post install script
```shell
mkdir tmp && cd "$_" \
git clone https://github.com/0xAquaWolf/post-install.git \
cd post-install \
./post-install
```
